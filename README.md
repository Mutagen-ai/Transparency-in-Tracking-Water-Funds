# Maji Ndogo: Visualizing the Currents of Change

## Project Overview
This project investigates water access, infrastructure, and safety in the fictional region of Maji Ndogo. It uses Power BI to transform complex datasets into interactive dashboards that reveal patterns in water source usage, pollution levels, queue dynamics, and crime incidents related to water collection.

## Objectives
- Integrate multiple datasets into a unified data model  
- Build a multi-star schema in Power BI for scalable analysis  
- Create dashboards that highlight disparities and risks in water access  
- Empower stakeholders with visual tools for decision-making

## Tools and Technologies
- Power BI for data modeling and visualization  
- DAX for calculated columns and measures  
- Excel for initial data cleaning and transformation  
- Survey and crime data as primary sources

## Key Components

### Data Model
- Multi-star schema with fact tables for water usage, crime, and queues  
- Dimension tables for location, gender, time, and water source type

### Dashboards
- Water Source Usage: Distribution and reliability across provinces  
- Pollution Mapping: Contamination levels of wells and taps  
- Queue Analysis: Wait times and crowding at shared water points  
- Crime and Safety: Gender-based risks and crime hotspots

## Insights
- Gender disparities in water collection and exposure to crime  
- Correlation between water access points and safety risks  
- Identification of high-risk zones for pollution and infrastructure failure  
- Temporal patterns in queue congestion and water demand
